<h2> Medieval Origins  </h2>

<p>The term Middle Ages was coined by scholars in the 15th century to designate 
    the interval between the downfall of the Classical world of Greece and Rome and 
    its rediscovery at the beginning of their own century, a revival in which they felt
     they were participating. Indeed, the notion of a long period of cultural darkness had
      been expressed by Petrarch even earlier.

<h2>Marsilio Ficino</h2>

<p>
    While the spirit of the Renaissance ultimately took many forms, 
    it was expressed earliest by the intellectual movement called humanism. 
    Humanism was initiated by secular men of letters rather than by the
     scholar-clerics who had dominated medieval intellectual life and
      had developed the Scholastic philosophy. Humanism began and 
      achieved fruition first in Italy.
